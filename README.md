 # 📊 Bank Loan Data Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data using Excel and Power BI to uncover key insights about loan applications, funding, repayments, and overall portfolio health. The main objective was to create interactive dashboards that support decision-making by providing a clear view of loan performance and customer behavior.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Excel** → Data cleaning, preprocessing, and initial analysis.  
- **Power BI** → Data visualization, KPI tracking, and interactive dashboards.

## 🔑 Key Features
- Analyzed **38K+ loan applications** with a total funded amount of **$435M** and a total received amount of **$473M**.  
- Built dashboards tracking KPIs such as:  
  - Total Loan Applications  
  - Funded vs. Received Amounts  
  - Average Interest Rate (**12%**)  
  - Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (**13%**)  
- Segmented loans by **state, purpose, employee length, term, and home ownership** to reveal trends and risk patterns.  
- Differentiated between **good vs. bad loans**, showing that **86.2% were good loans** and **13.8% were bad loans**.  

## 💡 Insights
- Most loan applications were concentrated in **longer employment groups** and **debt consolidation purposes**.  
- This revealed critical patterns for loan strategy and risk management, helping identify healthier loan segments and potential risk areas.  

## 🚀 Outcome
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of loan portfolio performance, enabling data-driven decisions and improving the bank’s ability to assess risk and optimize lending strategies.
